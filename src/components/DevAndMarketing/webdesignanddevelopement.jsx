            Static web development refers to a very simplistic approach toward
            the development process where content is not dynamic in nature;
            hence, it remains the same unless it is manually changed. Therefore,
            static websites turn out to be the best solution for businesses that
            want a clean and professional online existence without any complex
            functionality associated with them. All of the pages are pre-built
            and sent to the user exactly like they are, hence giving the best
            and continuous user experience with fast loading time. Static
            websites are very suitable for companies that need to communicate
            core information such as services, contact details, or even
            portfolios. Besides, static web development has improved security
            because of fewer vulnerabilities compared to dynamic sites.
            Maintenance is easier and, since it is an affordable web development
            site, it is perfect for start-ups or any entity that wishes for a
            solid, no-frills web presence. With fewer resources in hosting and
            development, more emphasis can be put on providing a credible and
            continuously available online experience.

            Dynamic websites employ server-side scripting with which content can
            change based on the user&apos;s action, time of the day, or any
            other feature. Due to the adaptability involved in this kind of
            website, dynamic websites suites very well for businesses having a
            plan to draw user's attraction through personalization. These sites
            can be constantly updated and can be linked to databases to offer
            the user information that is appropriate and accurate to the user at
            that time. Dynamic web development is important, therefore, for a
            business needing to drive more customization or offer greater
            engagement on their website or provide content features that enable
            users to be continuously satisfied. Moreover, this allows for
            content and functionality customization at the individual user level
            - a most powerful dynamic website feature that can be used to gain
            leverage in building higher conversions in today's highly
            competitive marketplace.
